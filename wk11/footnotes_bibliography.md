# Footnotes & Bibliography

Authors often need to add important information to the document that is not necessarily considered as the main content. Two examples are footnotes and bibliographical information.

>  **Footnotes** allows authors to leave notes to the reader in a way that does not breaks the flow of the document.
>
> **Bibliographical information** includes any sources of information that support the claims made in the document.

In the section we will learn how to insert and manage these two elements in MS Word.

## âš  Citing from the Internet

Not all sources found on the internet are a "web page".

> When citing work that was found online, ask yourself:
>
> **What kind of digital document is this?**
>
> - Examples:
>   - Books;
>   - Article in a journal;
>   - Article in an online newspaper or digital magazine;
>
> If it is, you must cite it as a printed document and add the URL
