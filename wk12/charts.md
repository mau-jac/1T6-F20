## Trendlines

Trendlines can be added to an graph to easily visualize a trend in the date.

There are different types of trendlines that can be used. The most common is a linear trendline.

## Diving Deeper (optional)

### Equation of a line

In the previous section we learned to add trendlines to a data set.

Once a trendline has been added, it is possible to extract the equation of that line and use those values to perform additional analysis on the data set.

<br>

The equation of a line is typically described as:

<br>

> If the **slope** and the **y-intercept** are known, then for any given X value we can find the respective Y value **and vice-versa**.

<br>

There are two ways of extracting the equations of a line from plotted data in Excel:

- Display the equation on the graph and manually write down the Slope and Y-intercept constants.
- Use the build-in `SLOPE` and `INTERCEPT` functions (prefered method)

## Exercises

Download the Excel file *wk12-charts-exercises.xlsx* available in Moodle under Week 12.

> Allways make sure your axis, title and legends are labeled properly.

### Exercise 1

Refer to the sheet *Staffing*

1. Insert a chart that will **visually contrast the staffing levels** of the current year and the two-year projection.
2. For the two-year projeciton, insert a pie graph that will show the each city department as a percent of total staffing.

### Exercise 2

Refer to the sheet *Enrollment*

1. Add a chart that will show any trends in enrollment data over time.
2. Set the minimum value of the Y-axis to 400 and it's maximum value to 900.
3. (challenge) For the McKinley school, insert a trendline and forecast it (extrapolate) it forward by two years (periods).
